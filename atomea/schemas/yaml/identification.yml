entity_ids:
  description: >+
    A uniquely identifying integer specifying what atoms belong to which entities.
    Entities can be a related set of atoms, molecules, or functional group.
    For example, a water and methanol molecule could be ``[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]``.

component_ids:
  description: >+
    Relates ``entity_id`` to a fragment label for chemical components or species.
    Labels could be WAT or h2o for water, MeOH for methanol, bz for benzene, etc.
    There are no standardized labels for species.
    The index of the label is the respective ``entity_id``.
    For example, a water and methanol molecule could be ``['h2o', 'meoh']``.
