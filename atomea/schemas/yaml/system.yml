coordinates:
  description: >+
    Coordinates refer to the specific three-dimensional positions of particles defined using a set of Cartesian coordinates (\(x\), \(y\), \(z\)).
  stype: array
  dtype: f8
  units: angstrom
atomic_number:
  description: >+
    The atomic number is a fundamental property of an atom and is denoted by the symbol \(Z\).
    It is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. In a neutral atom, the atomic number also corresponds to the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus.

  units: null
charge_net:
  description: >+
    The net charge of an atomic system is the overall charge determined by the balance between positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.
  stype: array
  dtype: f8
  units: e
multiplicity:
  description: >+
    The degeneracy or the number of possible spin states associated with a particular electronic state of a molecule.
    The multiplicity is denoted by the symbol \(2S+1\), where \(S\) is the total electron spin angular momentum.
    Here, \(S\) can take non-negative half-integer values, such as 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and so on.
    The multiplicity is always an integer.
